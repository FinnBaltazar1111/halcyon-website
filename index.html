      <h1>Defog Your Chromebook</h1>
      <p>E-Halcyon is a bypass for "The Fog," which is Google's mitigation for the unenrollment and downgrading of
        Chrome OS devices. It allows you to downgrade and bypass enterprise enrollment on managed Chromebooks, even if
        it's recieved the update that patched downgrading and enrollment escape.</p>
      <p>E-Halcyon is developed by Mercury Workshop, the developers behind sh1mmer</p>
      <!-- <p style="margin-top: 0px">RecoMod is a Chrome OS recovery image modification toolkit allowing for arbitrary code -->
      <!--   execution in verified mode. It provides the user with utilities that are useful for debugging and repair.</p> -->

      <h1>Instructions:</h1>


      <p>First of all, you'll need a linux PC or VM. WSL is not guaranteed to work</p>
      <p>Now, you'll need to boot into <a href="//sh1mmer.me">sh1mmer</a>, and press the Un-Enroll option. It won't
        truly unenroll you if you've recieved the 112 update patching unenrollment and downgrading, but it is still a
        necessary step for the rest of this. If you've never used sh1mmer before or don't have an image lying around,
        make sure to follow all the instructions on sh1mmer.me for unenrollment before proceeding with the rest of the
        tutorial here</p>
      <p>Next, you need a version 107 recovery image corresponding to your board, which you can pick up from <a
          href="//chrome100.dev">chrome100.dev</a>. Once you've downloaded the right image for your board and have
        confirmed it's for version 107, unzip it and save it to a safe place. Now open up a terminal and type in the
        following commands (make sure to replace /path/to/recovery/image.bin with the actual path)</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          git clone https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/RecoMod
          cd RecoMod
          chmod +x recomod.sh
          sudo ./recomod.sh -i /path/to/recovery/image.bin --halcyon --rw_legacy
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>The script will modify the image in place, and it can now be flashed with a standard recovery tool onto a USB
        of your choice.</p>
      <p>Enable devmode and get to the devmode block screen similarly to how you would with sh1mmer, then plug in the
        USB. The recovery screen will show up, and at this point you need to start spamming the E key on your keyboard.
        It will begin a 5 minute wait sequence, and near the end of the 5 minutes start spamming E again. You will only
        have to wait 5 minutes once, subsequent boots will have the 5 minute wait omitted</p>
      <p>
        The bootsplash will show, and you will enter a special menu. Use arrow keys to navigate the cursor down to
        "activate halcyon environment" and press enter.
        Then navigate down to "Install halcyon semi-tethered" and wait for it to finish.
        Once it's finished, go back to "activate halcyon environment" and press "Boot halcyon semi-tethered". and you
        will
        be booted into a downgraded and unenrolled ChromeOS environment.

      <h1>FAQ:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>How does this work?
          <p>See the <a href="https://coolelectronics.me/breaking-cros-5">writeup</a> for more information</p>
        </li>
        <li>Can the admins see that I'm doing this?
          <p> No. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Why don't my history/cookies/etc save after a reboot?
          <p>Unfixable restriction of cryptohome. See the <a
              href="https://coolelectronics.me/breaking-cros-5">writeup</a>
            for more information</p>
        </li>
        <li>Why is my Chromebook "Missing or damaged?"
          <p>After installing E-Halcyon, you won't be able to boot chromeos normally. You'll have to keep the usb around
            to jumpstart the booting process</p>
        </li>
        <li>Where do I report bugs?

          <p>The RecoMod <a href="//github.com/MercuryWorkshop/RecoMod">GitHub</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>Why does it say "E mode not activated" when I try to boot halcyon?

          <p>You spammed the E key when starting at the wrong time, or not at all</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
